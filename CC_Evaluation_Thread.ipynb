Assign a score from 1 to 100 for each parameter, with 1 being the worst and 100 being the best, considering a slightly strict scoring criteria. Provide an overall score by averaging the parameter scores. Additionally, assign a confidence score indicating your level of confidence in the provided scoring.The evaluation should be strict and large penalties on score should be given if parameter requirements are not satisfied. Finally, conclude with one of the following reasons for the overall score: \\\"There is scope for improvement in the response,\" \"The response generated is good,\" or \"The response is not good.\\\"\"\n",
